            <h2>Why A Healthy Diet is essential for Health And Nutrition? </h2>
            <p>It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</p>

                    If it’s too difficult to walk for 30 minutes at one time, do regular small bouts (10 minutes) 3 times per day and gradually build up to longer sessions.
If your goal is to lose weight, you will need to do physical activity for longer than 30 minutes each day. You can achieve this by starting with smaller bouts of activity throughout the day and increasing these as your fitness improves.
Physical activity built into a daily lifestyle plan is also one of the most effective ways to assist with weight loss and keep weight off once it’s lost.
Some suggestions to build walking into your daily routine include:
                </p>
                <li>Take the stairs instead of the lift (for at least part of the way).</li>
                <li>Get off public transport one stop earlier and walk to work or home.</li>
                <li>Walk (don’t drive) to the local shops.</li>
                <li>Walk the dog (or your neighbour’s dog).</li>
