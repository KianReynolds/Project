                <h3>Arnold Schwarzenegger: A Growing Influence!</h3>
                <p>
                    Bodybuilding and fitness today are much a product of their recent past and the works of Arnold Schwarzenegger. It has come a long way since Charles Atlas beckoned 90-pound weaklings in the back of dime magazines. Bodybuilders are bigger and leaner than ever, contests are beginning to be televised, and the fans are piling in. Today the Arnold Fitness weekend draws more than 40,000 people, making it the most popular bodybuilding event in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the 1960s bodybuilding has become a means to fitness, strength, and increased athletic performance in other sports. Home gyms are everywhere and more Americans train, are going to gyms, health clubs, and working out. Correspondingly the gym and supplement industries are flourishing. World renowned weightlifting guru Mike Katz has people in their 70s and 80s training with weights and conditioning at his World Gyms in Connecticut.

                <p>
                    Cash prizes are through the roof, and "the new generation of bodybuilders is as fired up about fitness as physique." People from all ends of the characteristic scale including the young and old, brawny and lean, and male and female enjoy the sport. Fairly recently bodybuilding has even emerged a new division of women's bodybuilding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Former Ms. Olympians such as Cory Everson and Tanya Knight have seen success in this area and drew their own crowds of fans. The success seen by the sport is largely a result of marketing efforts, but even more largely the result of an even larger man; the man with 22-inch guns, a 57-inch barrel chest, 28.5-inch tree-trunk thighs, and 20-inch calves the size of cows; the Austrian Oak, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is difficult to understand the profound influence that a single man can have over an entire population of people. Throughout the world Arnold Schwarzenegger is known as the charismatic bodybuilder, committed actor, and extreme motivator that he has built himself up to be. When Arnold began bodybuilding at the age of 15 he not only began to build his body, but his character, his reputation, his individuality, and his strong ever-lasting influence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His effect on society was extremely positive and will be felt for many years to come as family, races, and nations project themselves forward with healthy lives of exercising and fitness. The sport of bodybuilding has been set in motion and will continue to grow as it is pressed onward through the unending strength of time.
